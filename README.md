# Getting Started

This project is an assessment for kickstarting a React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast development build tool. It comes preconfigured with some basic settings to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vite-react-template.git
 

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```
   cd reeco
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and your React application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of your React application in the `dist` directory.

## Customization

You can customize this template to suit your project's needs. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Dependencies**: Feel free to add or remove dependencies from the `package.json` file based on your project requirements.

- **Project Structure**: You can organize your project files and folders as needed. The template provides a basic structure, but you can adapt it to your preferences.

- **Configuration**: You can configure your project settings in `vite.config.js`. Vite allows you to customize various aspects of your project, such as aliasing, CSS preprocessing, and more.
